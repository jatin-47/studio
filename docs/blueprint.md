## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #557A46 (RGB hex). A muted green evokes a sense of safety, and offers a high-tech, subtle feeling in contrast to a white background. It avoids the cliched look of brighter greens related to money.
- Background color: #F2F4F7 (RGB hex). A desaturated tint of green gives a bright background in support of the light scheme.
- Accent color: #7A5546 (RGB hex). An analogous desaturated orange-red suggests an element of alert that will highlight important page elements without calling the main theme into question.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for navigation and status indicators. Icons should be simple and modern in design.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear visual hierarchy. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter and improve readability.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and updates to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
